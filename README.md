# E-commerce back-end challenge

## Univeristy of Oregon Bootcamp Challenge #13
The challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application wonâ€™t be deployed, so I will create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met.

## User Story 
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
